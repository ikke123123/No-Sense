This is essentially a Unity Draughts game that puts an AI against an AI. While this was initially for a school project of over a year ago, I decided to rework it because the previous implementation was... interesting. So, consider this a work-in-progress as I try to find out what the best ways of storage, interaction, and simulation are.
